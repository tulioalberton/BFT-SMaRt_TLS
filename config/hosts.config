# This file defines the replicas ids, IPs and ports.
# It is used by the replicas and clients to find connection info to the initial replicas.
# The ports defined here are the ports used by clients to communicate
# with the replicas. Additional connections are opened by replicas to communicate with each other. 
# This additional connection is opened in the next port defined here. 
# For an example, consider the line "0 127.0.0.1 11000 11001".
# That means that clients will open a communication channel to replica 0 in IP 127.0.0.1 and port 11000 and 11001. 
# On startup, replicas with id different than 0 will open a communication channel to replica 0 in port 11001.
# The same holds for replicas 1, 2, 3 ... N.
